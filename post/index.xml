      <description>Rectangle problems are classic leetcode mono-stack problem and they are one of the hardest problem. That being said, just knowing to use mono-stack to solve the problem is not enough. I am going to dicuss on how to break down those problem for easier understanding and try to teach you a genernal pattern on how to resolve this kind of problem. For sample problems, check Count Submatrices With All Ones , or Largest Rectangle in Histogram</description>

      <description>This description/problem statement could be found here. We can take an example in the following to help us to derive the algorithm.
Input: A = [3,8,1,3,2,1,8,9,0], L = 3, M = 2 Output: 29 Explanation: One choice of subarrays is [3,8,1] with length 3, and [8,9] with length 2. ** Brute Froce Solution It should very easy and intuitive to think about this solution. In terms of question like string/array problem, I would recommend everyone to start to think from brute force solution first.</description>

      <description>This description/problem statement could be found here. This question can be disected by three parts.In the following, I am going to dicuss in details with code on how to proceed in each part.
The working solution is defined as followed
class Solution: def addBoldTag(self, s: str, dict: List[str]) -&amp;gt; str: #STEP1 intervals = [] for word in dict: start = 0 wordLength = len(word) startIndex = s.find(word, start) while startIndex !</description>

      <description>Graph is a very common algorithm problem that you encounter in the coding interviews. However, this articile is not explaining the basic of graph theory. Instead, this article mainly disucssed about when the problem should be sovled by graph theories. Of course, some problems are very obvious that you were given a tree or graph to work on. But sometimes, it&amp;rsquo;s not trival to identify whether the problem belong to graph.</description>
